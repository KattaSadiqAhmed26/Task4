****# Dashboard of Ola Sales Finance Data set.****  
This is Dashboard of Ola Sales where I divide this entire dataset into 5 slides and I created 5 slides linked one slide with other.    
There are 5 slides where I clearly focus on every thing over months and trends in the Bussiness.  
The 1st page is all about overall review of revenue and booking of the rides.   
The 2nd page is all about the the total revenue and booking and total sales in over all month by the vehicle type sp that we can clearly see the which vehicle is  
more in trend and demand.
The 3rd page is all about the overall Revenue and booking and top customer in the rides and revenue by the payment methods etc..  
the 4th slide is all about the cancellation of rides by this slide we can clearly see that where we lacking off like what are reasons rides is been cancelled and the  
reasons so that we can overcome it.  
The 5th slide is all about the rating given by the customer based on the vehicle performance and luxury and driver so that we can focus on the increase in the numbers of that particular vehicle.
